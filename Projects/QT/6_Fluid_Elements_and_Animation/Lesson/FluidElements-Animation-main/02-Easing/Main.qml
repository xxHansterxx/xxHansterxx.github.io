/*   This example demonstrates different easing curves available in Qt Quick animations.
 *
 *   Easing curves modify the interpolation of property animations to create more natural
 *   and appealing motion effects. Some of the  predefined curves can be categorized under:
 *      - Linear: No easing (constant velocity)
 *      - In/Out/InOut: Acceleration, deceleration, or both
 *      - Elastic: Oscillating effects with spring-like motion
 *      - Bounce: Simulates bouncing behavior
 *   You can see all the available easing types in the documentation.
 *   Reference: https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qml-qtquick-propertyanimation.html#easing.type-prop */
